## 🔍 New Issues Discovered (2026-03-18)

| # | Item | Priority | Status | Notes |
|---|------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `useNetworkStatus.ts` stub - package not installed | Medium | ✅ Done | Deleted non-functional stub file |
| 2 | `useInstallPrompt.ts` should be colocated | Low | ✅ Done | Moved to `src/components/InstallButton/` |
| 3 | `useDrillState` exposes raw setters - encapsulation leak | Medium | ✅ Done | Removed 9 raw state setters from public API |
| 4 | Eight features without `constants/` folders | Low | ✅ Done | Only `roulette-game` needed constants folder |
| 5 | Type exports from component barrels violate minimal API | Low | ✅ Done | Removed type exports from 15+ barrel files |
| 6 | `ScrollView` used for all lists - no `FlatList` | Low | ✅ Done | Updated `ProgressScreen.tsx` to use `FlatList` |
| 7 | `storage.service.ts` duplicates Redux persistence | Medium | ✅ Done | Removed duplicate `exerciseResults` persistence |
| 8 | Three parallel state persistence strategies | Medium | ✅ Done | Documented resolution in audit file |

### Notes:
- **useNetworkStatus.ts**: Package `@react-native-community/netinfo` not in `package.json`. Hook falls back to `isConnected: __DEV__ ? true : null` - non-functional in production
- **useInstallPrompt.ts**: PWA-specific hook used by single component, should be colocated
- **useDrillState**: Exposes 9 raw setters (`setScenario`, `setPhase`, `setSelectedOption`, etc.) that allow bypassing `handleSubmit` logic
- **Eight features without constants/**: blackjack-training, call-bets-training, caribbean-poker-training, racetrack-position-training, racetrack-sector-training, roulette-game, texas-holdem-ultimate-training, three-card-poker-training
- **Type exports**: `ChallengeDisplay/index.ts`, `MenuListScreen/index.ts`, and others re-export internal types
- **ScrollView vs FlatList**: All lists use `ScrollView`, no `FlatList` usage for performance optimization
- **storage.service.ts**: `exerciseResults` persisted in both Redux slice (`rouletteSlice.ts`) and AsyncStorage (`storage.service.ts`) - unclear source of truth
- **State management**: Three patterns (Redux, Context, Direct AsyncStorage) with no clear policy on when to use which

## 1. Logic Duplication — Hooks

### 1.1 `usePLOGameState` duplicates `useDrillState` (~95%)

**File:** `src/features/plo-training/screens/PLOGameTrainingScreen/usePLOGameState.ts` lines 28–68
**Original:** `src/hooks/useDrillState.ts` lines 43–138

```ts
// usePLOGameState.ts — lines 28-31 (DUPLICATE)
const [sessionPoints, setSessionPoints] = useState(0);
const [sessionCorrect, setSessionCorrect] = useState(0);
const [sessionTotal, setSessionTotal] = useState(0);
const [streak, setStreak] = useState(0);

// useDrillState.ts — lines 43-50 (ORIGINAL)
const [streak, setStreak] = useState(0);
const [sessionPoints, setSessionPoints] = useState(0);
const [sessionCorrect, setSessionCorrect] = useState(0);
const [sessionTotal, setSessionTotal] = useState(0);
```

The answer-check logic (streak increment, point calculation, phase transition) is also ~95% identical. PLO reimplemented the entire drill state machine instead of composing from the shared hook.

**Fix:** Refactor `PLOGameTrainingScreen` to use `useDrillState` or extract a shared base.

---

### 1.2 `useSectorTrainingSession` ≈ `usePositionTrainingSession`

**Files:**
- `src/features/racetrack-sector-training/screens/SectorTrainingScreen/useSectorTrainingSession.ts`
- `src/features/racetrack-position-training/screens/PositionTrainingScreen/usePositionTrainingSession.ts`

Both implement identical state shape: `currentWinningNumber`, `stats`, `isProcessing`, `generateNewNumber`. Only the validation function differs.

**Fix:** Merge into a single `useRacetrackTrainingSession(validationFn)` parameterized hook.

---

### 1.3 `useCallBetsState` — Incomplete + Not Using Shared Infrastructure

**File:** `src/features/call-bets-training/screens/CallBetsTrainingScreen/useCallBetsState.ts` lines 23–61

- Owns its own `correct/total` stats and phase management — doesn't use `useDrillState`
- Contains `// TODO: Implement answer validation` — core training feature has no answer checking

**Fix:** Implement validation + refactor to use `useDrillState`.

---

## 2. Constants Scattered — Duplicated Data

### 2.1 `DIFFICULTY_MAX_BET` defined twice

| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `src/constants/difficulty.ts` | 51–55 |
| `src/features/cash-conversion-training/constants/sectors.ts` | 19–23 |

Identical keys and values. Cash-conversion imports from its own copy, ignoring the shared one.

**Fix:** Delete feature-local copy, import from `src/constants/difficulty.ts`.

---

### 2.2 `SECTOR_NAMES` defined twice

| File | Lines |
|------|-------|
| `src/constants/sectors.ts` | 69–75 |
| `src/features/cash-conversion-training/constants/sectors.ts` | 11–17 |

Identical data, different `Record<>` type signatures.

**Fix:** Delete feature-local copy, import from `src/constants/sectors.ts`.

---

### 2.3 `DRILLS` arrays hardcoded inside 5 menu screen components

Configuration data living inside UI component files:

| File | Inline data (lines) |
|------|---------------------|
| `src/features/blackjack-training/screens/BJMenuScreen/BJMenuScreen.tsx` | 6–74 (68 lines) |
| `src/features/texas-holdem-ultimate-training/screens/THUMenuScreen/THUMenuScreen.tsx` | 6–78 (72 lines) |
| `src/features/roulette-knowledge-training/screens/RKMenuScreen/RKMenuScreen.tsx` | 6–82 (76 lines) |
| `src/features/caribbean-poker-training/screens/CPMenuScreen/CPMenuScreen.tsx` | 6–72 (66 lines) |
| `src/features/three-card-poker-training/screens/TCPMenuScreen/TCPMenuScreen.tsx` | 6–45 (39 lines) |

All follow identical TypeScript structure:

```ts
const DRILLS: {
  drillType: XxxDrillType;
  label: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'advanced';
}[] = [ ... ];
```

**Fix:** Move each to `src/features/<game>/constants/drills.ts`, import into menu screen.

---

### 2.4 Inline `modes` / `MODE_OPTIONS` arrays not extracted

| File | Lines | Inline constant |
|------|-------|----------------|
| `src/features/call-bets-training/screens/CallBetsMenuScreen/CallBetsMenuScreen.tsx` | 16–22 | `modes` array |
| `src/features/plo-training/screens/PLOMenuScreen/PLOMenuScreen.tsx` | 13–17 | `modes` array |
| `src/features/racetrack-sector-training/screens/SectorMenuScreen/SectorMenuScreen.tsx` | 18–57 | `SECTOR_ACCENT_COLORS` + `MODE_OPTIONS` |
| `src/features/racetrack-position-training/screens/PositionMenuScreen/PositionMenuScreen.tsx` | 18–36 | `POSITION_ACCENT_COLORS` + `MODE_OPTIONS` |

**Fix:** Move to `constants/modes.ts` inside each feature folder.

---

## 3. Type / Interface Disorganization

### 3.1 `BaseDrillScenario` referenced but never formally declared

`DrillScreen.tsx` uses `TScenario extends BaseDrillScenario` as a generic constraint, but the 5 feature scenario types (`BJScenario`, `TCPScenario`, `CPScenario`, `THUScenario`, `RKScenario`) don't formally extend it. The shared fields are duplicated by convention, not enforced by the type system.

**Shared fields duplicated across all 5:**
```ts
question: string;
answerType: 'multiple-choice' | 'numeric';
options?: string[];
correctOption?: string;
correctAnswer?: number;
explanation: string;
```

**Fix:** Declare `BaseDrillScenario` in `src/types/drill.ts`, have all feature scenarios extend it.

---

### 3.2 `AnswerType` literal union redefined in 4+ places

`'multiple-choice' | 'numeric'` is copy-pasted inline in each feature type file.
`TCPScenario` exports `AnswerType` as a named type — the other 4 features don't import or use it.

**Fix:** Export `AnswerType` from `src/types/drill.ts`, import everywhere.

---

### 3.3 `TrainingStats` shape likely duplicated

Both `useSectorTrainingSession` and `usePositionTrainingSession` define `TrainingStats` as `{ correct: number; total: number }`. Likely defined separately per feature instead of shared.

**Fix:** Add to `src/types/training.ts` (or similar shared types file).

---

## 4. Routing Organization

### 4.1 Cross-feature import

**File:** `src/features/roulette-game/screens/RouletteGameScreen/RouletteGameScreen.tsx` line 5

```ts
import { RouletteLayout } from '@features/roulette-training/components/roulette-ui';
```

Feature A imports from Feature B's internals. This creates a hidden coupling — renaming or restructuring `roulette-training` can silently break `roulette-game`.

**Fix:** Move `RouletteLayout` to `src/components/shared/` and update both imports.

---

### 4.2 No enforced naming convention for route param lists

Each feature defines `XxxStackParamList` independently with no shared interface or validation. Route name strings are not type-checked against the navigator — a typo in `navigation.navigate('SomeScreen')` fails silently at runtime.

---

## 5. Error Handling

### 5.1 Silent `.catch(() => {})` swallows failures

**Locations:** `ThemeContext.tsx`, `SettingsContext.tsx`, likely others.

AsyncStorage failures are silently ignored. Users lose persisted settings with no feedback and no log entry. In production this means invisible bugs.

**Fix:** Replace with `catch (e) { logger.warn('...', e); }`.

---

---

## 6. Root-Level Folder Audit

### 6.1 `src/config/` — Name Misleads What's Inside

**What's there:**
```
src/config/
├── env.ts          ← legitimate: reads Expo environment variables
├── betConfigs.ts   ← WRONG PLACE: domain constants, not app config
└── cashConfigs.ts  ← WRONG PLACE: domain constants, not app config
```

`env.ts` is the only true config file. The other two are data constants named with "config" in the file name, but that doesn't make them app configuration.

**`betConfigs.ts` problems:**
- Contains `BET_CONFIGS` — a large data object with payout values, hint text, number generators for each roulette bet type
- **Imports from a feature:** `import { ALL_CORNERS, ALL_STREETS, ALL_SIX_LINES } from '../features/roulette-training/constants/betCombinations'`
- A shared config importing from a feature's internals is a dependency inversion — arrow should point the other way
- Should either live inside `roulette-training/` or `src/constants/`

**`cashConfigs.ts` problems:**
- Contains `CASH_CONFIGS` — cash denomination configs per chip type ($1, $2, $5, $10, $25, $100)
- This is domain data for the cash-conversion-training feature
- Should live in `src/features/cash-conversion-training/constants/`

**Fix:** Move `betConfigs.ts` → `src/constants/` (and fix feature import), `cashConfigs.ts` → `src/features/cash-conversion-training/constants/`. Keep `env.ts` as the only file in `src/config/`.

---

### 6.2 `src/hooks/` — Mixed Concerns, One Stub

**What's there:**
```
src/hooks/
├── useDrillState.ts        ← domain-specific (training app)
├── useThemedStyles.ts      ← app-specific (depends on ThemeContext)
├── useModalState.ts        ← generic UI
├── useCascadingDropdowns.ts← generic UI
├── useMultiFieldInput.ts   ← generic UI
├── useInstallPrompt.ts     ← PWA-only, used by ONE component
└── useNetworkStatus.ts     ← stub (package not installed)
```

**`useInstallPrompt.ts` problem:**
- Used exclusively by `InstallButton.tsx` (one consumer)
- It's a PWA web-specific hook with no relevance to the React Native training app
- Should be colocated with `InstallButton` (`src/components/InstallButton/useInstallPrompt.ts`), not in shared hooks

**`useNetworkStatus.ts` is a stub:**
```ts
// Dynamic import — will fail if package not installed
const NetInfo = require('@react-native-community/netinfo');
```
The package `@react-native-community/netinfo` is not in `package.json`. The hook falls back to `isConnected: __DEV__ ? true : null`. This means in production it always returns `null` — it's non-functional dead code pretending to work.

**`useDrillState.ts` is large and exports types:**
- 209 lines — both the hook logic AND `BaseDrillScenario`, `DrillState<T>` interfaces
- Type definitions exported from a hook file, not from a types file
- `BaseDrillScenario` referenced by 5 feature scenario types but they don't formally extend it (covered in Section 3.1)

---

### 6.3 `src/services/` — Storage Service Coupled to Roulette Types

**`storage.service.ts` problem:**
```ts
import { UserProgress, ExerciseResult } from '../types/roulette.types';
```
A "shared service" layer that imports `UserProgress` and `ExerciseResult` from roulette-specific types. This means the storage service is NOT generic — it's a roulette service masquerading as shared infrastructure.

**Duplication with Redux:** `rouletteSlice.ts` already stores `exerciseResults: ExerciseResult[]` via Redux + redux-persist. `storage.service.ts` also has `saveExerciseResult()` writing to AsyncStorage directly. Two write paths for the same data — unclear which one is the source of truth.

---

### 6.4 `src/store/` — Inconsistent State Management (3 Patterns in 1 App)

The app has **three parallel persistence strategies** with no clear rule for which to use:

| What | Mechanism | Where |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Roulette game state (`placedBets`, `selectedChipValue`, `currentExercise`, `exerciseResults`) | Redux + redux-persist | `src/store/rouletteSlice.ts` |
| Theme preference | React Context + AsyncStorage | `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` |
| Sound/haptic settings | React Context + AsyncStorage | `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` |
| User progress | Direct AsyncStorage via service | `src/services/storage.service.ts` |

**✅ RESOLVED:** The duplicate `exerciseResults` persistence has been removed from `storage.service.ts`. Now `exerciseResults` are only persisted via Redux + redux-persist.

**Remaining consideration:** If Redux is only used for roulette, the overhead (redux-persist, PersistGate, typed hooks, whitelist config) may not be justified vs. a context approach consistent with the rest of the app. This is an architectural decision for future consideration.

---

### 6.5 `src/styles/` — Two Color Systems Active Simultaneously

```
src/styles/
├── themes.ts         ← NEW: AppColors interface, midnightTheme, casinoGreenTheme
├── colors.ts         ← OLD: COLORS object, hardcoded casino-green only
├── spacing.ts
├── shared.styles.ts
├── textStyles.ts
├── containerStyles.ts
└── index.ts          ← exports BOTH systems
```

`styles/index.ts` exports `COLORS` from `colors.ts` alongside the new system. Any new file importing from `@styles` can accidentally use the old static `COLORS` instead of the theme-aware `useTheme()` / `AppColors`. ErrorBoundary still uses `COLORS`. This is the zombie problem — old system still alive, new system exists, no policy on which to use.

`spacing.ts`, `shared.styles.ts`, `textStyles.ts`, `containerStyles.ts` are all static (not theme-aware). They use hardcoded values that may conflict or diverge from what the `themes.ts` system expects.

**Fix:** Mark `colors.ts` as deprecated, remove from `index.ts` export, migrate the one remaining consumer (ErrorBoundary), then delete the file.

---

### 6.6 `src/integration/` — One Test File, One Folder

```
src/integration/
└── __tests__/
    └── navigation.test.tsx  ← single file
```

A root-level folder with one test. Premature organization — a folder this thin adds structural noise without benefit. Move to `src/navigation/__tests__/` or alongside `AppNavigator.test.tsx`.

---

### 6.7 `src/test-utils/` — Two Render Utilities That Should Be One

```
src/test-utils/
├── render.tsx          ← wraps with NavigationContainer only
├── renderWithTheme.tsx ← wraps with ThemeProvider only
└── ...
```

`render.tsx` has a comment: *"All providers wrapper for tests — Add any global providers here (Redux, Theme, etc.)"* but only includes `NavigationContainer`. `ThemeProvider` was never added. So `renderWithTheme.tsx` was created as a workaround.

Result: tests that need navigation use `render`, tests that need theme use `renderWithTheme`, tests that need both have to compose manually. The `AllProviders` wrapper in `render.tsx` should include all providers (NavigationContainer + ThemeProvider + Redux Provider) and `renderWithTheme.tsx` should not need to exist.

---

### 6.8 Summary Table — All Root-Level Folders

| Folder | Files | Problem |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `config/` | 3 | `betConfigs` + `cashConfigs` are domain constants, not config. `betConfigs` imports from a feature. |
| `constants/` | 4 | Some constants duplicated in feature folders (see Section 2) |
| `contexts/` | 4 | Clean ✅ |
| `hooks/` | 7 | `useInstallPrompt` should be colocated. `useNetworkStatus` is a non-functional stub. |
| `integration/` | 1 | Single test file — folder is premature |
| `navigation/` | 2 | Clean ✅ |
| `screens/` | 9 | Clean ✅ |
| `services/` | 4 | `storage.service.ts` couples to roulette types + duplicates Redux persistence |
| `store/` | 3 | Three parallel state persistence strategies. `exerciseResults` persisted twice. |
| `styles/` | 7 | Two color systems active. `colors.ts` is legacy but still exported. |
| `test-utils/` | 7 | `render.tsx` missing `ThemeProvider` — `renderWithTheme.tsx` is a workaround that shouldn't need to exist |
| `types/` | 2 | Only 2 files — types scattered across codebase (see Section 3) |
| `utils/` | 9 | Evaluator logic mixed with utilities (see Section 6 below) |
| `components/` | 30+ | Clean ✅ |
| `features/` | 14 | Clean isolation ✅ |

---

## 7. Shared Folder Reorganization

### 7.1 Problem — `src/utils`, `src/types`, `src/constants` are unrelated root-level siblings

These three directories are all "shared across all features" — they're the same concept. There is no reason for them to sit at root level as separate siblings. A new developer opening `src/` sees 10+ top-level folders with no grouping to signal which are shared and which are feature-local.

**Current structure:**
```
src/
├── utils/          ← shared utilities
├── types/          ← shared types
├── constants/      ← shared constants
├── features/       ← feature modules
├── components/     ← shared components
├── hooks/          ← shared hooks
├── contexts/       ← shared contexts
├── navigation/
├── screens/
├── services/
├── store/
└── styles/
```

**Additional problem inside `src/utils/`:** The folder mixes two very different kinds of files:
- Generic utilities: `randomUtils.ts`, `accuracy.ts`, `roulette.utils.ts`, `chipUtils.ts`, `cardUtils.ts`
- Game evaluators (pure business logic): `blackjackEvaluator.ts`, `fiveCardEvaluator.ts`, `sevenCardBestHand.ts`, `threeCardEvaluator.ts`

Evaluators are not "utilities" — they are domain logic. Naming them as utilities obscures their purpose.

**Additional problem with `chipUtils.ts`:** It is a shared util but imports from a feature:
```ts
// src/utils/chipUtils.ts line 5
import { CHIP_DENOMINATIONS } from '../features/cash-conversion-training/constants/denominations';
```
A shared utility depending on a feature constant is a dependency inversion — the arrow should point the other way.

---

### 7.2 Target Structure — `src/shared/`

Group all cross-feature shared code under one `src/shared/` parent:

```
src/
├── shared/
│   ├── types/
│   │   ├── navigation.types.ts     ← move from src/types/
│   │   └── roulette.types.ts       ← move from src/types/
│   ├── constants/
│   │   ├── difficulty.ts           ← move from src/constants/
│   │   ├── sectors.ts              ← move from src/constants/
│   │   ├── navigation.constants.ts ← move from src/constants/
│   │   └── roulette.constants.ts   ← move from src/constants/
│   ├── utils/
│   │   ├── randomUtils.ts          ← move from src/utils/
│   │   ├── accuracy.ts             ← move from src/utils/
│   │   ├── cardUtils.ts            ← move from src/utils/
│   │   ├── chipUtils.ts            ← move from src/utils/ (fix import too)
│   │   └── roulette.utils.ts       ← move from src/utils/
│   └── evaluators/                 ← NEW: separated from generic utils
│       ├── blackjackEvaluator.ts   ← move from src/utils/
│       ├── fiveCardEvaluator.ts    ← move from src/utils/
│       ├── sevenCardBestHand.ts    ← move from src/utils/
│       └── threeCardEvaluator.ts   ← move from src/utils/
├── features/
├── components/
├── hooks/
└── ...
```

### 7.3 Path Alias Changes

Only `tsconfig.json` and `babel.config.js` change — **zero consuming import files need updating** because aliases absorb the path change transparently.

| Alias | Old path | New path |

### 7.4 Files That Need Import Fixes After Move

Files outside `src/shared/` that use **relative imports** (not aliases) to reach `src/types/` or `src/utils/` will break. Fix: replace with path aliases.

| File | Broken import | Fix |
|------|---------------|-----|
| `src/config/betConfigs.ts` | `'../types/roulette.types'` | `'@app-types/roulette.types'` |
| `src/services/storage.service.ts` | `'../types/roulette.types'` | `'@app-types/roulette.types'` |
| `src/store/rouletteSlice.ts` | `'../types/roulette.types'` | `'@app-types/roulette.types'` |
| `src/test-utils/builders.ts` | `'../types/roulette.types'` | `'@app-types/roulette.types'` |
| `src/test-utils/builders.ts` | `'../utils/randomUtils'` | `'@utils/randomUtils'` |
| `src/test-utils/fixtures.ts` | `'../types/roulette.types'` | `'@app-types/roulette.types'` |
| `src/shared/utils/chipUtils.ts` | `'../features/cash-conversion-training/...'` | `'@features/cash-conversion-training/...'` |

Relative imports **inside** `src/shared/` (e.g., `roulette.utils.ts` → `'../types/roulette.types'`) stay valid because both files move together.

Additionally, files importing `@utils/blackjackEvaluator` etc. need to be updated to `@evaluators/blackjackEvaluator`:

| File | Old import | New import |
|------|------------|------------|
| (features importing BJ evaluator) | `@utils/blackjackEvaluator` | `@evaluators/blackjackEvaluator` |
| (features importing five-card) | `@utils/fiveCardEvaluator` | `@evaluators/fiveCardEvaluator` |
| (features importing seven-card) | `@utils/sevenCardBestHand` | `@evaluators/sevenCardBestHand` |
| (features importing three-card) | `@utils/threeCardEvaluator` | `@evaluators/threeCardEvaluator` |

### 7.5 Priority

| Step | Action | Effort |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Create `src/shared/` and move the 3 folders + evaluators subfolder | Low |
| 2 | Update `@utils`, `@constants`, `@app-types` aliases in tsconfig + babel | Low |
| 3 | Add `@evaluators` alias, update 5 evaluator import lines in feature files | Low |
| 4 | Fix 7 relative→alias imports in 6 external files | Low |
| 5 | Fix `chipUtils.ts` feature dependency inversion | Low |
| 6 | Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify | Verification |

## 8. Additional Issues (Senior-Level Review)

### 8.1 Babel Test Config Missing `@contexts` and `@styles` Aliases

**File:** `babel.config.js`

The test and production sections have different alias sets. Two aliases present in production are **absent from the test section**:

```js
// TEST section (lines 26–39) — MISSING:
'@contexts': './src/contexts',   // ← not here
'@styles': './src/styles',       // ← not here

// PRODUCTION section (lines 55–69) — present:
'@contexts': './src/contexts',   // ✅
// @styles is ALSO missing from production
```

`@styles` is defined in `tsconfig.json` (lines 21–22) but absent from `babel.config.js` entirely — neither test nor production.

**Impact of `@contexts` missing from tests:** Every test that calls `renderWithTheme`, `useTheme()`, or `useSettings()` resolves `@contexts/ThemeContext` through Babel at runtime. If the alias isn't in the test config, the import silently falls through to `moduleNameMapper` in Jest config. If that's also missing, tests blow up at runtime with a module-not-found error. The fact that tests currently pass means Jest config has a `moduleNameMapper` workaround — but it's a hidden dependency that can break silently.

**Impact of `@styles` missing from Babel:** Any file importing `@styles` or `@styles/themes` runs through Babel at bundle time. TypeScript resolves it at compile time via tsconfig — but Babel doesn't know about tsconfig paths. If no module-resolver alias exists for `@styles`, the bundle will fail in any non-Jest environment that doesn't use the moduleNameMapper workaround.

**Fix:** Add both to `babel.config.js` — in both the test AND production sections:
```js
'@contexts': './src/contexts',
'@styles': './src/styles',
```

### 8.2 `navigation.navigate(route as never)` — Bypasses Type Safety

**File:** `src/screens/HomeScreen/HomeScreen.tsx` line 73

```ts
onSelectGame={(route: Route) => navigation.navigate(route as never)}
```

`as never` is the React Navigation workaround for untyped routes — but it completely disables the type checker on the navigate call. If a route name is renamed or removed from `RootStackParamList`, this line will compile fine and fail at runtime.

`Route` is exported from `src/constants/navigation.constants.ts` as a string union. The correct fix is to ensure `Route` is derived directly from `keyof RootStackParamList` so the navigate call has real type safety:

```ts
// navigation.constants.ts
import type { RootStackParamList } from '@navigation/AppNavigator';
export type Route = keyof RootStackParamList;

// HomeScreen
navigation.navigate(route);  // no cast needed
```

---

### 8.3 `shared.styles.ts` — Static, Not Theme-Aware, Has Hardcoded Colors

**File:** `src/styles/shared.styles.ts`

This file uses `StyleSheet.create({...})` as a static object — not a factory function. It was not migrated to the theme-aware pattern used by `textStyles.ts` and `containerStyles.ts`:

```ts
// textStyles.ts — theme-aware ✅
export function createTextStyles(colors: AppColors) { return StyleSheet.create({...}) }

// containerStyles.ts — theme-aware ✅
export function createContainerStyles(colors: AppColors) { return StyleSheet.create({...}) }

// shared.styles.ts — static, hardcoded ❌
export const sharedStyles = StyleSheet.create({
  stepNumberText: { color: '#000' },                          // line 216 — hardcoded
  closeButton: { backgroundColor: 'rgba(255,255,255,0.1)' }, // line 224 — hardcoded
  summaryContainer: { backgroundColor: 'rgba(26,95,63,0.5)'},// line 237 — hardcoded
})
```

Three hardcoded color values that don't respond to theme switching. Components using `sharedStyles` will show wrong colors in the midnight theme.

**Fix:** Convert to `createSharedStyles(colors: AppColors)` factory pattern consistent with the rest of `src/styles/`.

### 8.4 `useDrillState` Exposes Raw Setters — Encapsulation Leak

**File:** `src/hooks/useDrillState.ts` lines 23–62

The hook returns **31 properties**, including 9 raw state setters:

```ts
setScenario, setPhase, setSelectedOption, setUserAmountStr,
setIsCorrect, setStreak, setSessionPoints, setSessionCorrect, setSessionTotal
```

These setters are the internals of the state machine. Exposing them lets any consumer bypass `handleSubmit` (which handles scoring, streak, phase transitions) and mutate state directly — for example, calling `setStreak(5)` without going through the point calculation logic.

The public surface should be the handlers (`handleSubmit`, `handleNext`, `resetSession`) and the readable state. The raw setters should either be removed or clearly documented as internal escape hatches only.

**Why it matters:** If `usePLOGameState` were refactored to use `useDrillState`, it might reach for `setPhase` directly instead of using `handleSubmit` — breaking the streak/scoring logic silently.

---

### 8.5 Eight Features Without `constants/` Folders

Inline arrays and magic values in 8 feature folders that have no `constants/` directory (see Section 2.3 for the DRILLS arrays and 2.4 for modes arrays):

```
src/features/blackjack-training/          ← no constants/
src/features/call-bets-training/          ← no constants/
src/features/caribbean-poker-training/    ← no constants/
src/features/racetrack-position-training/ ← no constants/
src/features/racetrack-sector-training/   ← no constants/
src/features/roulette-game/               ← no constants/
src/features/texas-holdem-ultimate-training/ ← no constants/
src/features/three-card-poker-training/   ← no constants/
```

Six features already have `constants/` folders (`cash-conversion-training`, `plo-training`, `racetrack`, `roulette-training`, `roulette-knowledge-training`, `call-bets-training`). The remaining eight still have magic values inline in their screens.

---

### 8.6 Type Exports From Component Barrels Violate Minimal API

Some `index.ts` barrel files re-export internal `.types.ts` contents publicly. Per the colocation pattern, an `index.ts` should expose only what external consumers need — usually just the component itself:

```ts
// index.ts — what it should be:
export { ChallengeDisplay } from './ChallengeDisplay';

// index.ts — what it currently is:
export { ChallengeDisplay } from './ChallengeDisplay';
export type { ChallengeDisplayProps } from './ChallengeDisplay.types'; // ← unnecessary
```

When a `.types.ts` file is re-exported from the barrel, it becomes part of the public API surface. Any consumer can import the internal type, which creates hidden coupling — if the type changes, consumers break even though the component's behavior didn't change.

**Affected barrels:** `ChallengeDisplay/index.ts`, `MenuListScreen/index.ts`, and others in `roulette-training/components/index.ts`.

---

### 8.7 `AsyncStorage` Key Registry Is Implicit

Keys are scattered across files with no central record:

| Key | File |
|-----|------|
| `@app_theme` | `src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` |
| `@app_settings_sound` | `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` |
| `@app_settings_haptic` | `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` |
| `@casino_training_progress` | `src/services/storage.service.ts` |
| `@casino_training_results` | `src/services/storage.service.ts` |
| `root` (redux-persist) | `src/store/index.ts` |

No central `STORAGE_KEYS` constant. A developer adding a new key has no visibility into existing ones — a typo or collision would result in reading another module's data silently. The `storage.service.ts` already uses a local `STORAGE_KEYS` object internally — that pattern should be promoted to a shared `src/constants/storageKeys.ts` and imported by all three locations.

---

### 8.8 `ScrollView` Used for All Lists — No `FlatList`

Every menu screen and list in the app uses `ScrollView`. For small lists (5–10 items) this is fine. But there is **zero use of `FlatList`** in the entire codebase. If any list ever grows beyond ~20 items (e.g., a drill history log, progress screen), `ScrollView` renders all items at once causing memory/jank issues. Worth establishing a rule: lists with dynamic/unknown length use `FlatList`.

---

## What Is Clean (Do Not Change)

- Feature folder isolation — no other cross-feature imports detected
- `DrillScreen` / `DrillMenuScreen` shared components — already eliminating ~1,200 lines
- Theme system and `useThemedStyles` — consistent, zero hardcoded colors in new code
- `NumberPad` shared component — used across 7+ features correctly
- Two-tier error boundaries (global + feature-level)
- Logger service with Sentry integration
- Colocation pattern (21 components, 295+ tests)
- Accessibility props on all interactive elements
